# Readable

For this project, we will build a content and comment web app. 

Users will be able to post content to predefined categories, comment on their posts and other users' posts, and vote on posts and comments. Users will also be able to edit and delete posts and comments.

## Getting Started

First of all you can clone the project via the Git command

```
git clone https://github.com/Gonxis/Readable.git
```

Or maybe you want to [download it](https://github.com/Gonxis/Readable/archive/master.zip) instead.

After you get your copy of the project, you must enter to the folder you just get:

```
cd Readable-master
```

Inside the project you will have to install the dependencies with one of the following

* `yarn install`
* `npm install` / `npm i`

Now is time to start the project with one of these commands:

* `yarn start`
* `npm start`

In order to make it work, you will have to follow the same steps above but with the [server side](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-project-readable-starter) created by Udacity and instead of the last command to start the project, you will have to start the server, so instead of `yarn` or `npm`, you will have to do it via `node`.

```
node server
```
